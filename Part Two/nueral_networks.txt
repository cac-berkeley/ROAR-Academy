reinforcement learning trains a reward function to be better than humans, we have to give an environmnet 
we are inputting human data y such that machines can output a y* close to or better than humans
#gradient descent is the simplest form of machine learning
if AGI becomes really general it can be human intelligence
can be used to classify numbers or images
#all-or-none-principle
#perceptron model- takes the weighted sum and puts them into a step function(0 or 1) then takes it output
function needs to be differentiable, so we use sigmoid function since step function is not continous
#defining a model and addinga perceptron then compiling 
#model.fit givese you the x and y it will do the gradient descent
#seperate the training and testing data
#Output size=Input size−Kernel size+1
#pull a little switcharoo while speaking start with where everyone agrees
#short distance-ultrashound, midrange- LIDAR, long range- RGB camera
#you need GPS
#you need to have vehicle state sensing-> IMU, wheel speed sensor, motor speed sensor
#environment perception and object perception(label all the objects) and track objects
#motion planner takes into accoutn where you can go and where you cannot go, you want a detailed plan for the next three seconds
#you will send the plan into the controller
#Longitudinal control-> speed and break
#LAteral control-> steering and orientation
#Popular control algorithm-> Pure Pursuit Control, PID control, MPC(for high speeds)
#PID may only go in straight lines so you need to limit your curve
